# Neighbourhood-Map
 
This application is designed to add information about surf spots after you've had a surf session at the spot. 
The quality of a wave at different beaches is very dependent on the beach. 
A 2 meter swell can mean that one beach is complete madness, and another beach around the corner just starts working. 

After each session at a beach, you get to know it better and might want to jot down some notes about your impressions.
For example you could write something like:
'This break needs the swell to have some North in it and works best at low tide. 
There are strong rips at the South side of the beach
Starts working at 1 meter.'

Since a lot of these impressions can only be made after studying the surf forecast of that day, 
you can add the forecast of the day to the information of the surfspot. 
You can only add the forecast of the current day, so make sure you write down your observations on the same day you surfed!

## How to add a location?
Click the `+` on the right hand corner of the window. After pinning the new location to the map you can drag it to it's correct
location. 

## How to edit a location?
Simply select the location, show all info, and doubleclick either the name or the info text to edit them. 

## Import/Export
Since all data is currently stored to LocalStorage, you can't see the data in different browsers. 
However, you can export the data to a file and import this file it on a different machine/browser!

## Possible future improvements
Add posibility to add information and forecast about multiple sessions to a surfspot.
