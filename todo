-Modularize that geocode request loop, and delete from app
-start with world map and add locations by markers, save this data in localstorage, figure out a way to export this data and then a way to use this data as initial data for udacity coaches
-Make function to export locations to json
-use a fun style on your map, also different marker. something opaque? 
-when adding a new location, the button 'add location' (a 2nd one) should not work untill half a second after the marker is displayed (so the marker is actually created). Maybe even add a loading sign or something like that.
-Remove small infowindow from mobile devices
-When clicking on name, zoom to center like in google maps class (setcenter and zoom to location)
!create init function that sets up this.places and selectedplace and newplace and so on... (declutter the viewmodel)
